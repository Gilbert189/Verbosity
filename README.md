# Verbosity
Verbosity is a Java project that is made to be as verbose as possible and as extensible as possible. 
When run, it should output "the above post is too verbose".

While it's not quite enterprise grade like [FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition), 
it is verbose enough to win the Most Verbose Post Before Reset award on the MAXIMUM VERBOSITY topic.

## Structure
Verbosity is made to take advantage of the OO aspects of Java as much as possible, 
utilizing enums, interfaces, varargs, all of them at the same time. 
Javadoc comments are also added to compliment/document the code for verbosity.

## Critics

> I think you win.
